Background of the project
With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, the requirements for antenna technology are getting higher and higher. Especially in the fields of radar, wireless communications and other fields, the performance of the antenna directly affects the overall performance of the system.  In order to improve the performance of the antenna system, accurately predicting the far-field pattern of the antenna has become an important research topic.  This project aims to use deep learning methods to accurately predict the pattern of cylindrical array antennas and provide efficient and accurate solutions.

Project goal: Use deep learning methods to predict the far-field radiation pattern of cylindrical array antennas. The main goals of the project include:

Design and train a deep learning model: the input is the antenna's excitation information, and the output is the far-field radiation pattern.
Build a user-friendly GUI interface: allow users to input incentive information and view the predicted direction map in real time.
Data rationality and innovation: Ensure that the structure of the data is complete and reasonable, the methods meet the publishing standards of top journals, and are innovative to a certain extent.
Technical solutions

data preparation:
Collect and organize antenna excitation information and corresponding far-field pattern data.
Perform data preprocessing, including data cleaning, normalization and data enhancement.
Model design:
Use complex network structures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to capture spatial and temporal features in the data.
Employ ensemble learning methods such as random forest or gradient boosting to improve the model's prediction accuracy.
Model training:
Models are trained using large-scale data sets and cross-validation methods are used to evaluate model performance.
Optimize model hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy and stability.
GUI development:
Use MATLAB to create a GUI interface with a progress bar that allows users to enter incentive information.
After the model prediction is completed, another GUI interface pops up to display the predicted direction map.
Results verification and comparison:
Compare the prediction results with the results of other algorithms or simulation software to verify the validity and accuracy of the model.
Analyze the results and propose improvement plans.
